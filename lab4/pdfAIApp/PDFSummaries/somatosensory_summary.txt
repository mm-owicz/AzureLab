The somatosensory system is comprised of various receptors located in the skin, muscles, tendons, and joints, which provide critical sensory information. Cutaneous receptors in the skin detect temperature (thermoreceptors), pressure, surface texture (mechanoreceptors), and pain (nociceptors). Key receptors include Meissner corpuscles, which help adjust grip force during object lifting, and Merkel's receptors, which are involved in texture and form perception, particularly concentrated in areas like the digits and around the mouth.

Muscle and joint receptors, such as muscle spindles, supply information about muscle length, tension, and joint angles, contributing to motor activity response. Notably, rapidly adapting receptors respond quickly to changes in stimuli, while slowly adapting receptors sustain responses to prolonged pressure. Nociceptors, characterized by free nerve endings, are responsible for pain sensation and have varying activation thresholds. Overall, the somatosensory system plays a crucial role in enabling tactile sensation and coordinating motor actions in response to environmental stimuli.
