In May 2017, DrylabNews published its first newsletter of the year, highlighting significant developments for the company. The primary focus is the upcoming launch in the American market, with updates on sales, new capital, personnel changes, and an investment round that successfully raised 2.13 million NOK, complementing a loan from Innovation Norway, resulting in a total of 5 million NOK of new capital. The newsletter welcomes several new owners and reports an impressive 80% return customer rate, noting new clients including Film Factory Montreal and Lumiere Numeriques.

The company has expanded its team, adding two permanent developers and several interns, while also gaining a new mentor, Caitlin Burns, an established producer. In early 2017, key meetings were held in the U.S. with major industry players like Netflix and Apple, and Drylab participated in the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas. Although development of the new Drylab 3.0 is slightly behind schedule, the team is focused on launching in September during the International Broadcasters Convention in Amsterdam.

The newsletter concludes with an invitation to the Annual General Meeting on June 16, emphasizing a busy spring and commitment to both the U.S. launch and sustaining momentum in Europe.
